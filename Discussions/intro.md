1. What are we trying to solve ?

    We are trying to strategically improve the way the fantasy league are conducted in todays market. Trying to unlock the full analytical side of the cricket lovers and involve them in the game. 
    In our way of conducting the cricket mania we generally have pool where user can register ! Then they should create a team with an amount ( fixed bid ) that we provide to them. Then as the match starts his ranking in the leaderboard changes according to the players performance [ we will be having predefined rules set upon which players are evaluated per ball]. This is fine and you may think that how is it different from existing fantasy leagues in the market (Dream11, My11circle, MPL ...). Things are not yet done, while they are creating there team the user can unlock the power of our league by not selecting the complete 11 players before the match. Yes you heard it true ! we have a min player criteria before the match which the player's tram should satisfy, i.e it is okay if he only picks min_players before the start of the match. Now the player can fill the remaining slots during the game. But remember as we mentioned it as a strategy contest, there won't be any free lunch ! So buying players during the match comes at a cost of player net_value (player_performance + player_demand).
